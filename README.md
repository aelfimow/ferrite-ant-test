# ferrite-ant-test
Test of three ferrite antennas for receiving very low frequency (VLF) signals.

## Overview of ferrite rods
The ferrite rods have been recycled from old radios. The material and frequency range
is unfortunately unknown.

Ferrite rod | Length (cm) | Diameter (cm)
---|-------------|-------
Fer-A | 20 | 1
Fer-B | 16.5 | 1
Fer-C | 14 | 1
